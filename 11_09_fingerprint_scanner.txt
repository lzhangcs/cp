问题如下， 谢谢解答：

When using KeyguardManager.createConfirmDeviceCredentialIntent() on Huawei device which have a fingerprint scanner (eg. P9), the screen only works with PIN/Password but does not allow unlock with the fingerprint scanner. On most other brands that works. Is this a known issue? I could not find any Stack Overflow entry. Is this problem known to Huawei?

I know I could use the Fingerprint API, but this method works already from Android 5.0 onwards and is not restricted to fingerprint.
